Our pretrained method refers to https://github.com/nupurkmr9/S2M2_fewshot.

After you have trained the self-supervised pre-trained model, you should extract the features and put it in the path "../checkpoints/{data}_{backbone}/features.plk".

Or you can download our extracted features at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UPRZc-yZVvv7PWY3SXpmKYLUKjL-raxJ?usp=sharing
