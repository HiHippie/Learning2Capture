# Learning2Capture

## Embedding Function

Our embedding function refers to the S2M2_R, and its source code is available at: https://github.com/nupurkmr9/S2M2_fewshot.

pleast refer to it for the backbone training.

## Embedding Extraction

You can run "save_plk.py" for the embedding extraction.

Or you can download our extracted features at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UPRZc-yZVvv7PWY3SXpmKYLUKjL-raxJ?usp=sharing

## Evaluation

You can make evaluation through the "Learning2Capture.py".
